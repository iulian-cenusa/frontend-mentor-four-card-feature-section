## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I consolidated CSS grid and CSS flexbox knoledge and learn about box shadows and content positioning.

### Continued development

As with every project this is not complete. It can be improved to look exactly like the design files.
